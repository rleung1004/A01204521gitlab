The extension .md mean markdown. README.md is used to generate the html summary of a project.

With markdown, the document is light-weight and its syntax is easy to use for styling purposes, just like html.

The difference is that markdown is more readable and light-weight compared to html, while you are still able to style your text unlike txt files.
